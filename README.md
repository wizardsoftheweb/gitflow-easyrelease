[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wizardsoftheweb/gitflow-easyrelease.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wizardsoftheweb/gitflow-easyrelease) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/wizardsoftheweb/gitflow-easyrelease/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/wizardsoftheweb/gitflow-easyrelease?branch=master)

`gitflow-easyrelease` aims to streamline `git flow release` commands. It adds some [semver](https://semver.org/) shortcuts as well.

## Installation

```sh-session
$ pip install --user gitflow-easyrelease
```

## Usage

```sh-session
$ export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
$ which git-easyrelease
~/.local/bin/git-easyrelease
$ git easyrelease
< should print the main help >
$ git easyrelease --all-help
< dumps all the help >
```

## Positionals

### `version`

`version` can be one of the following:

* `p`, `patch`, or `~` for a patch bump
* `m`, `minor`, or `^` for a minor bump
* `M` or `major` for a major bump
* `X.Y.Z` for a new, unconnected semver version
* `<any string>` for a not semver version

### `base`

`base` is an optional branch to use as the base for the release. It requires [the extended `gitflow-avh`](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh), but it's totally optional and shouldn't break anything if you both don't have `gitflow-avh` and never use `base`.

## Commands

### `init`

`git easyrelease init [base]`

Convenience method to seed the release with `0.0.0`. It runs

```sh-session
$ git flow release start 0.0.0 <base>
$ git flow release finish
```

### `quick`

`git easyrelease quick version [base]`

Convenience method to start and finish a release branch. It runs

```sh-session
$ git flow release start <version> <base>
$ git flow release finish
```

### `start`

`git easyrelease start version [base]`

Extends `git flow release start` with extra semver functionality. It runs

```sh-session
$ git flow release start <version> <base>
```

### `finish`

`git easyrelease finish [version]`

Extends `git flow release finish` with extra semver functionality. Without `version`, it attempts to `finish` the active branch. It runs

```sh-session
$ git flow release finish <version>
```

### `publish`

`git easyrelease publish [version]`

Extends `git flow release publish` with extra semver functionality. Without `version`, it attempts to `publish` the active branch. It runs

```sh-session
$ git flow release publish <version>
```

### `delete`

`git easyrelease delete [version]`

Extends `git flow release delete` with extra semver functionality. Without `version`, it attempts to `delete` the active branch. It runs

```sh-session
$ git flow release delete <version>
```

## Roadmap

These percentages are pretty arbitrary. Today's 47% could be tomorrow's 90% or vice versa.

### Main Features

Once all of these are finished, I'll release `v1`. Until then, `v0` should be used with caution, because it's not stable.

| Progess | Feature |
| ------: | ------- |
|     42% | Testing |

### Eventual Features

These are things I'd like to add, but probably won't be included in `v1`. If not, they'll most likely constitute one or more minor version increments.

| Progess | Feature |
| ------: | ------- |
|     10% | `git config` integration (or, rather, `gitflow` config integration) |
|      0% | Disable `base` without `gitflow-avh` |
